# Orthogonal Matrices; Deﬁnition and Simple Properties
# A matrix whose rows or columns constitute a set of orthonormal vectors is
# said to be an orthogonal matrix. If Q is an n × m orthogonal matrix, then
# QQ T = I n if n ≤ m, and Q T Q = I m if n ≥ m. If Q is a square orthogonal
# matrix, then QQ T = Q T Q = I. An orthogonal matrix is also called a unitary
# matrix. (For matrices whose elements are complex numbers, a matrix is said
# to be unitary if the matrix times its conjugate transpose is the identity; that
# is, if QQ H = I.)
QQT <- as.matrix(eq, c(Ax, QR, B))
length(n) > 1
x <- window(QQT)
QQH <- as.single(QQT, c(Ax, QR, B))
H <- sqrt(n + 2)
c(H)

# The determinant of a square orthogonal matrix is ±1 (because the deter-
# minant of the product is the product of the determinants and the determinant
# of I is 1).
c(H) + sin(x)

# The matrix dot product of an n × m orthogonal matrix Q with itself is its
# number of columns:
n * m10
Q <- col(m10)
Q + sin(n)


# This is because Q T Q = I m . Recalling the deﬁnition of the orthogonal binary
# relationship from page 75, we note that if Q is an orthogonal matrix, then Q
# is not orthogonal to itself.
cars <- nrow(m10)
QR.Q <- citHeader(cars)

# A permutation matrix (see page 62) is orthogonal. We can see this by
# building the permutation matrix as a product of elementary permutation ma-
# trices, and it is easy to see that they are all orthogonal.
